Ten Quality Control Principles to Improve Vendee–Vendor Relations
Principle
Ishikawa Principle
Application in Construction Projects
Principle 1
Both vendee and vendor are fully 
responsible for the quality control 
application and harmonizing their 
quality control systems
The owner, consultant, and contractor 
are fully responsible for application of 
quality control to meet the defined 
scope of work in the contract 
documents
Principle 2
Both vendee and vendor should be 
independent of each other and 
respect the independence of the 
other party
The contractor shall follow an 
agreed-upon quality control plan, and 
the consultant shall be responsible for 
overseeing compliance with contract 
documents
Principle 3
The vendee is responsible for 
supplying clear and adequate 
information and requirements to 
the vendor so that the vendor can 
know precisely how and what 
should be manufactured
The consultant is responsible for 
providing the owner’s requirements 
explicitly and clearly defining them in 
the contract documents
Principle 4
Both vendee and vendor, before 
entering into business transactions, 
should conclude a rational contract 
between them in respect to quality, 
quantity, price, delivery systems, 
and method of payment
The contractor should study all the 
documents during the tendering/
bidding stage and submit his proposal 
taking into consideration all the 
requirements specified in the contract 
documents
Principle 5
The vendor is responsible for the 
assurance of quality that will give 
satisfaction to the vendee, and he 
is also responsible for submitting 
necessary and actual data upon the 
vendee’s request
The contractor is responsible for 
constructing the facility as specified 
and using materials, products, 
equipment, and methods that satisfy 
the specified requirements?","responsible for 
supplying clear and adequate 
information and requirements to 
the vendor so that the vendor can 
know prec."
"The 
contractor shall follow the submittal 
procedure specified in the contract 
documents
Principle 6
Both vendee and vendor should 
decide the evaluation method of 
various items beforehand, which 
will be accepted as satisfactory to 
both parties
Method of payment (work progress, 
material, equipment, etc?","factory to 
both parties
Method of payment (work progress, 
material, equipment, etc."
"Rate analysis of BOQ or BOM item to 
be agreed upon before signing of the 
contract
Principle 7
Both vendee and vendor should 
establish in their contract the 
systems and procedures through 
which they can amicably settle 
disputes whenever any problems 
occur
Contract documents should include a 
clause to settle disputes arising during 
the construction stage itself
Principle 8
Both vendee and vendor, taking into 
consideration the other party’s 
standing, should exchange the 
information necessary to carry out 
better quality control
Each member of the project team 
should participate in all the functional 
areas to improve the quality of the 
project

ordering, production and

relationship is maintained and 
remains amicable and satisfactory

dealing with business transactions, 
should always take full account of 
the consumer’s interests
The contractor should build the facility 
as stipulated in the contract 
documents, plan, and specifications
