Types of Wells
There are numerous different ways that oil well can be drilled to maximize the output of the well while minimizing other costs. The most common type of well drilled today is known as a conventional well. These wells are wells drilled in the traditional sense in that a location is chosen above the reservoir and the well is drilled vertically downward. Additionally, wells with a small amount of deviation in their path from the vertical are also considered to be conventional. This slight turning of the well is obtained during drilling by using a type of steerable device that shifts the direction the well is being dug. These wells are the most common and are fairly inexpensive to drill.[2]

Horizontal wells are an alternative type of well used when conventional wells do not yield enough fuel. These wells are drilled and steered to enter a deposit nearly horizontally. These wells can hit targets and stimulate reservoirs in ways that a vertical well cannot.[3] Combined with hydraulic fracturing previously unproductive rocks can be used as sources for natural gas. Examples of these types of deposits include formations that contain shale gas or tight gas.[4]

Other types of wells include offshore wells, which are wells that are drilled in the water instead of onshore. These provide access to previous inaccessible oil deposits. Multilateral wells are wells used occasionally that have several branches off of the main borehole that drain a separate part of the reservoir.
